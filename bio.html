		<h2>Timothy S. O'Sullivan - Biography</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>I am an undergraduate Tufts University student, Class of 2015, majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering. My hometown is Stratford, Connecticut.</p>
		<h3>Hobbies</h3>
		<p>Before college, I was deeply devoted to martial arts, studying Taekwondo, Boxing, Hapkido, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu through the years. I hope to return to the lifestyle after graduating. Presently, my pastimes are more tame. I usually listen to several hours of music each day. My favorite genres are classical and metal, with Mozart, Angra, and Sylosis my current favorites. I divide my free time between video games (favorite genre: rpg), books (favorite authors: Dostoyevsky and Murakami), and manga (favorite genre: seinen/psychological). Finally, I try to play as many games of Go as I can.</p>
